Writing examination could be a challenging task for the persons with disabilities. Those with
visual impairment find it difficult to read questions and write answers. Similarly, persons with
locomotor disabilities may also face difficulty in writing exams as well as doing practical
exams in labs etc.

The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment mandates that disabled students should be
provided with extra time during the examination in order to compensate the loss of speed /
ability in writing the answers.

A person with benchmark disability can make use of a scribe / readers / lab assistant while
giving exams. Scribe is a person who writes answers on behalf of the student. A reader helps
in reading the text for the disabled student. A lab assistant is a person who is familiar with the
laboratory environment and helps the student in practical exams.

scribes are a tool to help the student access the instructions, directions, questions, and you are
a tool to help the student express her/his own thoughts. You do not correct errors. You write
exactly what is being expressed. No raised eyebrows when they get it 'wrong' and no clue is
given by you with respect to the content or form of their answer.
